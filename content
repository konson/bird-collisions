#ATLSavesBirds

Each year, up to a billion birds perish from colliding with buildings in the United States. During the day, migrating species struggle with reflective surfaces. At night, they’re disoriented by brights lights. You can help reduce the number of deaths by reporting collision victims or volunteering with our organization.  Atlanta saves birds - and you can be part of the effort.
